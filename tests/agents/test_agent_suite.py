# import pytest # Removed unused import

# This file can be used to group agent tests or define shared fixtures/marks.
# Currently, tests seem to be in individual files (e.g., test_appsec_engineer_agent.py)

# Example of marking tests (if needed):
# @pytest.mark.agent_test
# def test_some_agent_feature():
#     assert True

# Example of shared fixture (if needed):
# @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
# def shared_agent_resource():
#     print("\nSetting up shared resource for agent tests")
#     yield "shared_data"
#     print("\nCleaning up shared resource for agent tests")

# If you intend to run specific tests from here, you would import them.
# For example:
# from .test_appsec_engineer_agent import test_appsec_initialization

# For now, this file primarily serves as a placeholder for potential suite-level config.
