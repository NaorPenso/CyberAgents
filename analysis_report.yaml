report: "Security Analysis Report for Domain: \"naorpenso.com\"\n\n1. Subdomain Discovery:\n\
  \   - A Certificate Transparency log search using crt.sh revealed multiple externally\
  \ facing subdomains associated with \"naorpenso.com\". The discovered subdomains\
  \ are:\n       \u2022 api.meet.naorpenso.com\n       \u2022 auth.meet.naorpenso.com\n\
  \       \u2022 event.meet.naorpenso.com\n       \u2022 meet.naorpenso.com\n    \
  \   \u2022 www.naorpenso.com\n\n2. Observations and Analysis:\n   - The variety\
  \ of subdomains suggests a structured deployment strategy where different subdomains\
  \ may serve distinct functions:\n         \u2022 \"api.meet.naorpenso.com\": Likely\
  \ dedicated to hosting API endpoints.\n         \u2022 \"auth.meet.naorpenso.com\"\
  : Presumably handles authentication processes.\n         \u2022 \"event.meet.naorpenso.com\"\
  : May be used for event management or real-time communication tasks.\n         \u2022\
  \ \"meet.naorpenso.com\" and \"www.naorpenso.com\": Likely serve as primary web\
  \ access interfaces for users.\n   - Although the initial scan did not include associated\
  \ IP block details, these subdomains clearly outline the external components that\
  \ constitute the attack surface of \"naorpenso.com\".\n\n3. Recommended Follow-up\
  \ Analyses:\n   - DNS Analysis: To resolve the discovered subdomains into IP addresses\
  \ and to identify additional DNS records (e.g., A, MX, NS, TXT) that might provide\
  \ further insights.\n   - Threat Intelligence Analysis: To check whether any of\
  \ the subdomains are associated with malicious activities or if they have any known\
  \ vulnerabilities.\n   - Additional Exposure Analysis: To perform ASN/IP block lookups\
  \ and potential Nmap port scanning on the subdomains to evaluate open ports and\
  \ running services, ensuring that no critical vulnerabilities are exposed.\n\nOverall\
  \ Conclusion:\nThe subdomain scan for \"naorpenso.com\" has identified a diverse\
  \ set of externally facing assets. Each subdomain appears to serve distinct purposes,\
  \ indicating a distributed service architecture. It is recommended that organizations\
  \ monitoring \"naorpenso.com\" continue with further DNS, threat intelligence, and\
  \ infrastructure scans to ensure comprehensive security coverage against any potential\
  \ vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.\n\nThis comprehensive report highlights\
  \ the current externally visible subdomains for \"naorpenso.com\" and provides a\
  \ roadmap for additional security analyses."
