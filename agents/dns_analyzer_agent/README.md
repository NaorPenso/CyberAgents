## Role

## Goal
Analyze and extract structured DNS records for a specific domain.

## Tools
- `DNSTool`: Performs the DNS record lookups.

## Expected Input to Task
- A domain name (implicitly provided via the context or manager's delegation).
- Optionally, a list of specific record types to query (defaults to A, MX, NS, TXT, AAAA).

## Expected Output from Task
- A dictionary where keys are DNS record types (e.g., "A", "MX", "DNSSEC") and values are lists of record data (strings) or a boolean for DNSSEC. Returns `{"error": ...}` on failure or `[]` for records not found.
