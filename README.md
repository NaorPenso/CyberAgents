# CyberAgents

CyberAgents is a framework for defining, documenting, and orchestrating AI-powered cybersecurity agents. Each agent represents a specialized function within modern security operations, from detection to governance to remediation. The goal is to enable scalable, modular, and automated cybersecurity processes using agent-based architecture.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- **Modularization** of cybersecurity roles into discrete agents
- **Declarative definitions** using structured YAML for clarity and automation
- **Asynchronous coordination** of agents via defined workflows
- **Extensibility** for new agents, tools, knowledge, and domains
- **Documentation-first** to ensure clarity, auditability, and usability

Each agent is defined with:
- A unique identifier and responsibilities
- A system prompt (for LLM-backed agents)
- A list of tools and external knowledge used
- Clearly defined inputs and outputs
- A sequenced list of steps and logic
- Associated documentation and knowledge artifacts

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/CyberAgents.git
   cd CyberAgents
   ```

2. Run the setup script to initialize folders and templates:
   ```bash
   ./create_cyber_agents.sh
   ```

3. Start defining each agent's YAML configuration and replace placeholder READMEs.

## 📦 Releases

- Each agent will be versioned independently using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Version tags reflect only meaningful changes to that specific agent
- Central changelogs will be published per agent under `/agents/<agent>/CHANGELOG.md`
