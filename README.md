# CyberAgents

CyberAgents is a framework for defining, documenting, and orchestrating AI-powered cybersecurity agents. Each agent represents a specialized function within modern security operations, from detection to governance to remediation. The goal is to enable scalable, modular, and automated cybersecurity processes using agent-based architecture.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- **Modularization** of cybersecurity roles into discrete agents
- **Declarative definitions** using structured YAML for clarity and automation
- **Asynchronous coordination** of agents via defined workflows
- **Extensibility** for new agents, tools, knowledge, and domains
- **Documentation-first** to ensure clarity, auditability, and usability
- **Quality Assurance** through automated validation and testing

Each agent is defined with:

- A unique identifier and responsibilities
- A system prompt (for LLM-backed agents)
- A list of tools and external knowledge used
- Clearly defined inputs and outputs
- A sequenced list of steps and logic
- Associated documentation and knowledge artifacts

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/CyberAgents.git
   cd CyberAgents
   ```

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

1. Start defining each agent's YAML configuration and replace placeholder READMEs.

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

The project includes several validation mechanisms:

1. **YAML Schema Validation**

   - Validates agent definitions against `schemas/agent_schema.yaml`
   - Validates workflow definitions against `schemas/workflow_schema.yaml`
   - Ensures proper structure and required fields

1. **Agent Structure Validation**

   - Verifies presence of required files and directories
   - Checks documentation completeness
   - Validates knowledge base organization

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**

   - Code formatting (Black)
   - Linting (Flake8)
   - Type checking (MyPy)
   - YAML validation

1. **GitHub Actions**

   - Runs on every pull request to main
   - Executes all validation checks
   - Ensures tests pass
   - Validates YAML files and agent structure

## 📦 Releases

- Each agent will be versioned independently using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Version tags reflect only meaningful changes to that specific agent
- Central changelogs will be published per agent under `/agents/<agent>/CHANGELOG.md`
