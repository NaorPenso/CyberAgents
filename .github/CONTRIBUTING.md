## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and automated releases. Please ensure your commit
messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Issues and Discussion

We encourage you to open an issue or discussion before making a major change. This helps us
avoid duplicated efforts and ensures your solution aligns with the project's direction.

Thanks again for your contribution!
