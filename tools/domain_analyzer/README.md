# Domain Analyzer Tool

## Overview
The Domain Analyzer tool processes WHOIS and DNS data to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security risks associated with domain names. It provides a risk score and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Features
- Domain age analysis
- Nameserver consistency checking
- Domain structure analysis
- Risk scoring system
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern recognition
- Actionable recommendations

## Usage
```python
from tools.domain_analyzer import analyze

# Analyze domain data
result = analyze(whois_data, dns_data)
```

## Analysis Components

### Risk Scoring
The tool calculates a risk score based on various factors:
- Domain age (new domains are riskier)
- Nameserver consistency
- Domain structure complexity
- Registration patterns

### Anomaly Detection
The tool identifies several types of anomalies:
- Recent domain registrations
- Nameserver mismatches
- Suspicious domain structures
- Unusual registration patterns

### Pattern Recognition
Identifies common patterns in:
- Domain naming conventions
- Subdomain structures
- Registration behaviors
- Nameserver configurations

## Output Format
The tool returns a dictionary containing:
- Risk score (0-100)
- List of detected anomalies
- Identified patterns
- Security recommendations

## Dependencies
- python-dateutil>=2.8.2
- tld>=0.13.0

## Security Considerations
- Consider rate limiting for bulk analysis
- Cache results for frequently analyzed domains
- Implement additional verification for high-risk domains

## Example Output
```json
{
    "risk_score": 35,
    "anomalies": [
        "New domain (less than 30 days old)",
        "Nameserver mismatch between WHOIS and DNS"
    ],
    "patterns": [
        "Multi-level subdomain structure"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Consider additional verification steps"
    ]
}
