tool:
  name: nmap_port_scanner
  type: python # Relies on python-nmap wrapper, but fundamentally calls external nmap
  description: "Performs a port scan using Nmap on specified targets and ports. Returns structured data about open ports, protocols, and services found. Requires Nmap executable to be installed. Use responsibly."
  version: "0.1.0"

implementation:
  language: python
  dependencies:
    - python-nmap>=0.7.1 # Dependency for the wrapper
  # Also has an external dependency on the nmap executable

    required: true
  - name: ports
    type: string
    description: "Comma-separated list of ports or port ranges (e.g., '80,443', '1-1024'). Defaults to common ports."
